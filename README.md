# Faucet generator
Make your own testnet faucet

# How to try it
Click here: https://supertestnet.github.io/faucet_generator/

Generate a private key and select a network. Fund your faucet with coins from that network, and now you've got a faucet with no rate limits.

If you want a direct link to your faucet, the format is this:

https://supertestnet.github.io/faucet_generator/#network=signet#privkey=abababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab

But replace signet with whatever network you want it to work on (options are: testnet | testnet4 | signet | mutinynet) and replace the privkey with the one you generated earlier.

You can also *gift* people a faucet by funding one using a random private key and then sending them the link.
