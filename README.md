# Faucet generator
Make your own testnet faucet

# How to try it
1. Click here: https://supertestnet.github.io/faucet_generator/
2. Generate a private key by clicking the "Generate private key" button
3. Save your private key somewhere safe
4. Select a network
5. Fund your faucet with coins from that network, and now you've got a faucet with no rate limits
6. If you want a direct link to your faucet, the format is this: https://supertestnet.github.io/faucet_generator/#network=signet#privkey=abababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab
7. But replace signet with whatever network you want it to work on (options are: testnet | testnet4 | signet | mutinynet) and replace the privkey with the one you generated in step 2
8. You can also *gift* someone a faucet by generating a random private key for it, funding the resulting address, and then sending the link to whoever you want.
